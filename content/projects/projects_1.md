#### Acoustic Monitoring for Migratory Birds in Northeastern Siberian Arctic Tundra (2020-)
Indigirka River Delta is one of the most productive tundra area in Siberia that supports 40 â€“ 60 migratory bird species each summer. Despite the magnificent avifauna, only few research expeditions had been conducted in the delta since it is difficult and expensive to survey with human observers. Automated acoustic recording systems are potential solutions enabling large scale monitoring. However, previous studies had shown the importance of evaluating the detection performance of recorders under spatially variable survey conditions in advance of implementation. In this study, we will investigate the utility of an acoustic recorder for monitoring abundance of tundra birds relative to point count surveys.

#### Automatic Bird Sound Detection: Logistic Regression Based Acoustic Occupancy Model (2017-2019)
Avian bioacoustics research was greatly assisted by the introduction of autonomous recording units, which not only allow remote monitoring but also make large-scale studies possible. However, manual inspection of acoustic recordings becomes more challenging with increasingly larger datasets. In this study, we developed a logistic model to predict the probability of bird presence in audio recordings using sound frequency percentiles. The acoustic recordings covered bird songs and calls in a wide range of environments (e.g., grassland, forest, urban areas) along with the presence of noise due to weather, traffic, insects, and human speech.

#### Previous Fire Severity Enhances Reburn Severity: A Case Study in Interior British Columbia, Canada (2017-2019)

Forests in interior British Columbia (BC), Canada are naturally maintained by wildfires; however, wildfire characteristics in interior BC have been shifting with climate change, where longer, warmer, and drier summers may alter the existing fire regimes. For this, resources have been devoted to developing and applying innovative post-fire management strategies, in order to lower the probability of subsequent fire events and/or lower the severity of subsequent fires. This study aims to determine whether and how the severity of previous fire influenced the reburn severity in the Riske Creek are in interior BC, and provide insights into developing post-fire management strategies, in order to lower the probability of reburn and/or lower the reburn severity.

#### High Spatio-Temporal-Resolution Detection of Chlorophyll Fluorescence Dynamics (2015-2016)

Chlorophyll fluorescence (CF) is a key indicator to study plant physiology or photosynthesis efficiency. Conventionally, CF is characterized by fluorometers, which only allows ensemble measurement through wide-field detection. Here we demonstrated a fluorometer based on confocal imaging, that not only provides high contrast images, but also allows CF measurement with spatiotemporal resolution as high as micrometer and millisecond. Confocal imaging fluorometers provide micrometer and millisecond CF characterization, opening up unprecedented possibilities toward detailed spatiotemporal analysis of CF transients and its propagation dynamics, as well as photosynthesis efficiency analysis, on the scale of organelles, in a living plant.
